## What is it?

Ephemera is a TTRPG system for 2+ players (a gamesmaster plus players)
wherein the majority of the actions available and checks made are determined
through the use of a set of items generated at the start of play and a single D6.

The idea is that you have a selection of items available to you and you must
use these items in _some way_ in order to escape the situation you are in.
The difficulty check is determined by how well you can convince the GM
that your usage of items is valid. The better you are at convincing the GM that
your use case is good the easier the check on the D6.

## Difficulty checks

Difficulty checks are done using a single D6 with the player needing to get a number equal to or above the difficulty rating determined by the GM based on their description and justification for how they have solved the challenge with their item.
Every player is basically assumed to be **Average Person**. They have the average skills of an average person. This means they're not secretly an Olympic athlete that can jump 20m in one go. Assume they have roughly the skills that the actual person playing does.

| Rating | Difficulty                                                                   |

|   1    | Piece of piss. This is as simple as opening an unlocked door.                |
|   2    | Bit harder. Convincing your boring partner to dance to the Macarena.         |
|   3    | Needs effort. Opening a jar of unopened pickles that are about 20 years old. |
|   4    | Hard. Tying your shoelaces whilst drunk.                                     |
|   5    | Stupidly tricky. You're picking a lock with a paper clip.                    |
|   6    | Nigh on impossible. You're winning a bar fight with a feather.               |

## Ephemera

### Generating Ephemera

At the start of play, roll a D100 5 times plus one additional roll for each player character after the first and write down the item in the table below matching the number.

For example, with two players plus the GM you would roll 6 times. For 4 players plus the GM you would roll 8 times.

| Number | Item                                                                                                                                                |
