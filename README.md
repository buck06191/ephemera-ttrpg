# Ephemera - An escape room TTRPG

[![CC BY-SA 4.0][cc-by-sa-shield]][cc-by-sa]

## What is it?

Ephemera is a TTRPG system for 2+ players (a gamesmaster plus players)
wherein the majority of the actions available and checks made are determined
through the use of a set of items generated at the start of play and a single D6.

The idea is that you have a selection of items available to you and you must
use these items in _some way_ in order to escape the situation you are in.
The difficulty check is determined by how well you can convince the GM
that your usage of items is valid. The better you are at convincing the GM that
your use case is good the easier the check on the D6.

## Difficulty checks

Difficulty checks are done using a single D6 with the player needing to get a number equal to or above the difficulty rating determined by the GM based on their description and justification for how they have solved the challenge with their item.
Every player is basically assumed to be Average Person. They have the average skills of an average person. This means they're not secretly an Olympic athlete that can jump 20m in one go. Assume they have roughly the skills that the actual person playing does.

| Rating | Difficulty                                                          |
| :----: | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   1    | Piece of piss. This could be as simple as opening an unlocked door. |
|   2    | Bit harder.                                                         |
|   3    | Needs effort.                                                       |
|   4    | Hard.                                                               |
|   5    | Stupidly tricky. You're picking a lock with a paper clip.           |
|   6    | Nigh on impossible. You're winning a bar fight with a feather.      |
